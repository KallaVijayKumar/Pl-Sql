PL/SQL variables must be declared in the declaration section or in a package as a global variable. When you declare a variable, PL/SQL allocates memory for the variable's value and the storage location is identified by the variable name.

The syntax for declaring a variable is −

variable_name [CONSTANT] datatype [NOT NULL] [:= | DEFAULT initial_value] 
Whenever you declare a variable, PL/SQL assigns it a default value of NULL. If you want to initialize a variable with a value other than the NULL value, you can do so during the declaration, using either of the following −

The DEFAULT keyword
The assignment operator
DECLARE 
   a integer := 10; 
   b integer := 20; 
   c integer; 
   f real; 
BEGIN 
   c := a + b; 
   dbms_output.put_line('Value of c: ' || c); 
   f := 70.0/3.0; 
   dbms_output.put_line('Value of f: ' || f); 
END; 
/
